    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both logistic regression and random forest models achieve high AUC and accuracy, indicating that the engineered features capture much of the signal for adoption.\n",
    "* **Recency features (`session_recency_days` and `account_age_days`) dominate the feature importances**, suggesting that users who continue to use the product well after sign‑up are far more likely to be classified as adopted.  These variables may partially leak information about adoption since they incorporate post‑signup behaviour.\n",
    "* Smaller, yet informative features include organization size and whether the user was invited.  Users from larger organizations and those invited by others show slightly higher adoption rates.  Creation source provides modest signal; sign‑ups via Google or guest invites tend to adopt more frequently than personal project invites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Onboarding and engagement:** Focus on engaging new users during their first weeks.  Encourage them to log in at least three times within a week through targeted emails or in‑app prompts.\n",
    "* **Invite flows:** Since invited users show slightly higher adoption rates, simplify the process for existing users to invite colleagues and friends.  Provide incentives or rewards for successful invitations.\n",
    "* **Product education:** Users who join via personal project invites have the lowest adoption rates.  Offer onboarding tutorials or guided walkthroughs tailored to these users to highlight the value of collaborative features.\n",
    "* **Retention campaigns:** Leverage the marketing drip campaign and mailing list to send personalised reminders and tips to users who have not logged in recently.  Since recency strongly predicts adoption, timely nudges could convert more users into long‑term adopters.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using login events and user metadata provided by Relax Inc., we identified adopted users (those who log in at least three times in a seven‑day window) and explored how adoption varies across account characteristics.  Adoption rates are highest among users who sign up via Google or guest invites, while personal project invites lag behind.  Being invited by an existing user and receiving marketing communications also correlate with higher adoption.  Predictive models built on engineered features achieve high accuracy, although recency variables dominate and may capture behaviour after sign‑up.  To improve adoption, we recommend focusing on user engagement in the first week, enhancing invite flows, providing tailored onboarding for certain sign‑up channels, and continuing to leverage targeted marketing.\n",
